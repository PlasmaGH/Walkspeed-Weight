# Walkspeed-Weight
Walkspeed made easy

## Useage:

> Let's do an example, let's say we want to disable the player's ability for them to walk.

The function called should look something like this:

```
WalkspeedWeight.Update_Weight_Tag(Humanoid, "TestTag" 0, nil)
-- Humanoid:Humanoid, Tag_Name:string, Speed:number, Time_Duration:number
```
